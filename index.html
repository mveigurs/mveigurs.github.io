        <h3>Cats are mysterious!</h3>
        <p>The earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus,
            dating to about 7500â€“7200 BC. Since there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat 
            and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland.</p>
        <p>In ancient Egypt, cats were worshipped, and the goddess Bastet often depicted in cat form, sometimes taking on the war-like aspect of a lioness. The Greek historian 
            Herodotus reported that killing a cat was forbidden, and when a household cat died, the entire family mourned and shaved their eyebrows. Families took their dead 
            cats to the sacred city of Bubastis, where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories.</p>
        <p>Many cultures have negative superstitions about cats. An example would be the belief that encountering a black cat ("crossing one's path") leads to bad luck, or that 
            cats are witches' familiars used to augment a witch's powers and skills.</p>
        <p>According to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives. In many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some 
            Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives</p>

        <p>A few attempts to build a cat census have been made over the years, both through associations or national and international organizations</p>
        <p>General estimates for the global population of domestic cats range widely from anywhere between 200 million to 600 million.</p>
